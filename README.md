# BikeDashAndroid
Android Half of Bike Dash

This is the android app that communicates via bluetooth with the Arduino circuit in BikeDashArduino.
Last built with Android Studio 2.3.2.  
Tested only on Moto G version 1 with Lollipop and LG Optimus One with Gingerbread.  It should now work back to API 9, Gingerbread.
Doesn't work immediately on a Samsung S5 with Marshmallow.  I suspect it's a permissions issue.

Note that if you want to open this project directly in Android Studio, it must be in a directory called "DeviceSpeedDemo".  Otherwise you have to import it into Studio.

I can't find where I got the 7 segment font file from.  Please let me know if it's yours and I will credit it.

The beginning of the GPS code came from here http://www.edumobile.org/android/device-speed-demo-in-android/ .

The launcher icon came from the awesome Android Asset Studio tool https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/ .
