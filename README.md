# BikeDashAndroid
Android Half of Bike Dash

This is the android app that communicates via bluetooth with the Arduino circuit in BikeDashArduino.
Last built with Android Studio 2.3.1.  
Tested only on Moto G version 1 with Lollipop.
Doesn't work immediately on a Samsung S5 with Marshmallow.  I suspect it's a permissions issue.
